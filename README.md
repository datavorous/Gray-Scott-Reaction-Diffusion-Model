# Gray-Scott-Reaction-Diffusion-Model
This program simulates a reaction-diffusion system using a grid of cells. Reaction-diffusion systems are mathematical models used to describe how concentrations of one or more substances distributed in space change under the influence of two processes: local chemical reactions (which create or annihilate the substances) and diffusion.
